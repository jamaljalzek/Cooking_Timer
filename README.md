# Cooking_Timer
This is a Java program that is designed to track the time (hours and minutes) while cooking food. It then visually notifies you once the timer hits 0.

More specifically:
1. It first prompts the user to type in the hours and minutes needed to cook their food.
2. Next, it validates their input, potentially displaying an error message.
3. A time count down is then displayed, which shows the remaining hours and minutes left (updated every minute).
4. Finally, a notification window is generated, which is programmed to appear on top of all other windows open,
such as any web browser or other unassociated program(s).
